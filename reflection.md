What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was helpful to go to TA hours where I was able to talk to other students who were also having trouble with the assignment as well as get assistance from the TAs. Testing the code helped me figure out what worked and what did not work. Starting with the computer class made it somewhat easier to start the resale shop class.
